## Why Laravel Coolify?

Self-hosting with Coolify is powerful, but switching between your app and the Coolify UI gets tedious. This package brings infrastructure management **into your Laravel app**.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Beautiful Dashboard" icon="laptop">
    Monitor deployments, view logs, manage env vars - all from `/coolify` in your app. Works like Horizon.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Artisan Commands" icon="terminal">
    Deploy from CI/CD, scripts, or your terminal. Full control without touching a UI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auto Dockerfiles" icon="document">
    Production-ready Docker config generated automatically. Horizon, Reverb, Scheduler detected and configured.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full API Access" icon="rocket">
    Build custom tooling, automations, or integrations with the complete Coolify API.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Dashboard Preview

- Database and cache status with connection strings
- Recent deployments with inline expandable build logs
- One-click deploy, restart, and rollback
